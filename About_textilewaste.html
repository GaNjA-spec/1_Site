   <pre><h2 class='transition-fade'>What is textile waste</h2><pre>
   <pre><p class='transition-fade'>   The material that is wasted during the production process is known as textile waste. Each stage of the 
   creation of a product, including spinning, weaving, dyeing, finishing, and even after it is completed, 
   might result in the production of this waste.</p></pre>
   <p class='transition-fade'>
   Within the fashion industry, textile waste is a major problem that adds to environmental and sustainability 
   problems. The fast-paced cycles of production and consumption that the fashion industry is known for are 
   fueled by shifting customer demands and fashion trends. This quick turnover of garments has significantly 
   increased the production of textile waste at numerous 
   supply chain stages:
  </p>
   <ul><p class='transition-fade'><b><u>Manufacturing:</u></b><br>Pre-consumer waste is frequently produced during the manufacture of textiles and garments due to cutting 
waste, defective products, and overproduction. These materials are occasionally thrown away or downcycled, 
which causes inefficiencies and more waste.</p>  
    <p class='transition-fade'><b><u>Design trends:</u></b><br>Short-lived fashion trends can quickly become outmoded, resulting in fashion waste by causing clothing items 
associated with earlier trends to quickly become unwelcome.</p>
   <p class='transition-fade'><b><u>Consumer behavior:</u></b><br>Consumers routinely buy new clothes and throw away their old ones, which adds to the amount of post-consumer 
textile waste. Fast fashion's emergence has intensified this tendency because items that are less expensive 
and of lower quality are more likely to be thrown away after only a few wears.</p>
