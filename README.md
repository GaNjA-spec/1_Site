Welcome,
I am a 17 year old, male aspiring to be a web designer.

This is my first site that I built as a Inter-School web design competition and won 2nd place.

The topic is fast fashion and its effects.

There were following instructuons given:
1. Smooth navigation
2. Proper and researched information
